Plotting using PGFPLOTS
=======================
Here are a few zip files that contain sample PGF plots source files. They are commented so that you know what each line does. You can modify these files to make other plots.

1.  **A simple plot:** See the files in this folder to obtain a simple plot. The ".tex" file is the source file. This is an example of creating a simple plot by reading a data file. It also explains you how you can perform simple manipulations on the data. [Simple\_plot](./Plotting/Simple_plot.tar.gz)
2.  **Matrix of several bar plots:** Also reads a data file from various folders and makes bar plots. [Matrix\_of\_plots.tar](./Plotting/Matrix_of_plots.tar.gz) has the following features.
    1.  Generate bar plots with error bars B/W
    2.  Generate colored bar plots with error bars
    3.  Arrange them logically based on specific rules
    4.  Put alphabets on the plots at precise locations
3.  **Two plots, each with many data:** You can learn to plot many data lines in the same axes.[Multiple\_plots\_on\_same\_axes.tar](./Plotting/Multiple_plots_on_same_axes.tar.gz) has the following additional features.
    1.  Add legends
    2.  Cycle automatically through many plotting styles
    3.  Put an arrow and show something on the plot
    4.  See how to control the frequency of the markers on a line plot
    5.  Make many line plots on the same axes
    6.  Control the location of the legend
4.  **Plotting many functions:** This example shows you how to plot many functions. In addition, you can learn how to [Plotting\_functions.tar](./Plotting/Plotting_functions.tar.gz)
    1.  place legends
    2.  vary line styles
    3.  alter the background color of the plot
    4.  add grid lines to the plot
5.  **Writing on a plot:** This example shows you how to write on a line [Writing on a plot](./Plotting/Writing_on_a_plot.tar.gz). In addition
    1.  you can learn how to use for loops for repeating things. This is done in the following example, for arrows which begin along the sin curve and end at some point defined by a function.
6.  **Log plots:** These files, will teach you to make semilogx, semilogy and loglog plots. [logplots.tar](./Plotting/logplots.tar.gz)
7.  **Getting Double Y Axis:** These files can be used in case your plot requires a Y axis to be on the right in addition to the one on the left. [Double Y-axis](./Plotting/Double-Y-axis.zip)
8.  **Insets:** Sometimes, graphs need insets to highlight a region of the plot. The following files will help you with that. [Inset Plot](./Plotting/Inset-Plot.zip)
9.  **3D Bar plots**: These files can help you set up to set up a 3D bar plot.[3-D\_bar\_plot](./Plotting/3-D_bar_plot.zip)
